Automated Online Retail System:

This program was written to automate the usually tedious process of uploading products from the family business' website to other online retailers such as Etsy, Ebay, etc. The program scrapes the product page, downloading images and all the necessary information (descriptions, titles, prices). This data is then processed and sorted using regex. The program then analyzes the sorted data to generate suitable content (tags etc.), fills in required fields intuitively, and uploads product images.
